    simplest method is to stop and restart ConfD with the new .fxs files
    in place. CDB will then detect the change and perform an upgrade,
    automatically or assisted by external programs, as described in
    <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;CDB - The ConfD XML Database">Chapter&nbsp;5, <i>CDB - The ConfD XML Database</i></a>.</p><p>If it is necessary that ConfD keeps running throughout the
    data model change, we can instead control the upgrade from an
    external program using a set of MAAPI functions, as described in
    this chapter. The CDB upgrade will be performed in this case too of
    course, and all the techniques described in the CDB chapter are
    applicable here too. But in addition, this procedure requires
    careful synchronization between different ConfD components,
    e.g. transactions may not span the data model change, and all
    components must update any related data, while still being able to
    revert to the original data model in case problems are
    detected.</p><p>The following four sections describe the phases and
    corresponding MAAPI function calls that comprise this upgrade
    procedure, and the steps that must be taken by the program
    controlling the procedure. A complete example showing the procedure
    can be found in
    <code class="filename">examples.confd/in_service_upgrade/simple</code> in the
    bundled examples collection. The code excerpts and description
    refer to this example. See also the <a class="xref" href="rn02re14.html" title="confd_lib_maapi"><span class="refentrytitle">confd_lib_maapi</span>(3)</a> manual page for the
    definitions of the MAAPI functions.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e3658"></a>13.2.&nbsp;Preparing for the Upgrade</h2></div></div></div><p>All the new .fxs files, clispecs, MIBs, etc, as well as the
    <code class="filename">docroot</code> tree for the Web UI (if used), that are
    to be used after the upgrade, must be installed separately from the
    current ones, and the current ones may not be removed until the
    upgrade has completed successfully. A good way to organize this is
    to have the references to the installation directories in
    <code class="filename">confd.conf</code> use a symbolic link. This way we can
    switch the on-disk data to the new version by simply changing the
    link, without the need for complex modification of
    <code class="filename">confd.conf</code>. Files that are unchanged between
    the two versions should be duplicated, or possibly (hard-)linked if
    disk space is limited.</p><p>In the example, we use two directories
    <code class="filename">pkg/v1</code> and <code class="filename">pkg/v2</code> for the
    old and new versions, respectively, and a symlink
    <code class="filename">pkg/current</code> that points to the currently used
    version. In <code class="filename">confd.conf</code> both
    <code class="sgmltag-element">/confdConfig/loadPath/dir</code> and
    <code class="sgmltag-element">/confdConfig/webui/docroot</code> are then given with the use of
    the symlink. Multiple loadPath directories are of course also
    possible, by having subdirectories below <code class="filename">v1</code>
    and/or <code class="filename">v2</code>.</p><p>For MIB (.bin) files other than the ones built-in to ConfD,
    <code class="filename">confd.conf</code> offers two possibilities: we can
    either specify the actual file names with
    <code class="sgmltag-element">/confdConfig/snmpAgent/mibs/file</code> elements, or use
    <code class="sgmltag-element">/confdConfig/snmpAgent/mibs/fromLoadPath</code> to tell ConfD to
    load these files from the directories given via
    <code class="sgmltag-element">/confdConfig/loadPath</code>. To have the symlink scheme work
    for the MIB files on upgrade, we need to use the latter alternative,
    and only specify built-in MIBs via
    <code class="sgmltag-element">/confdConfig/snmpAgent/mibs/file</code>.</p><p>The <code class="filename">upgrade.c</code> program in the example
    controls the upgrade procedure. It can be run either standalone or
    via a <code class="sgmltag-element">osCommand</code> specification in the clispec. In both
    cases it must connect a MAAPI socket and associate it with a user
    session. When running from the CLI, it must use the user session id
    provided by the environment variable
    <code class="varname">CONFD_MAAPI_USID</code> for this, otherwise it can
    start a new user session:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">static int set_usess(int sock)
{
    char *user = "admin";
    const char *groups[] = {"admin"};
    char *context = "system";
    struct confd_ip ip;

    /* must use usid from CLI to be allowed to run across upgrade */
    if ((usid_env = getenv("CONFD_MAAPI_USID")) != NULL) {
        return maapi_set_user_session(sock, atoi(usid_env));
    } else {
        ip.af = AF_INET;
        inet_pton(AF_INET, "127.0.0.1", &amp;ip.ip.v4);
        return maapi_start_user_session(sock, user, context, groups, 1,
                                        &amp;ip, CONFD_PROTO_TCP);
    }
}
</pre></div><p>Applications connected to ConfD, e.g. data providers and CDB
    subscribers, are not directly affected by the upgrade procedure. If
    they need to take some action due to the upgrade, they should be
    subscribed to <code class="constant">CONFD_NOTIF_UPGRADE_EVENT</code> event
    notifications (see <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;12.&nbsp;Notifications">Chapter&nbsp;12, <i>Notifications</i></a>), and will
    then be notified of the different phases of the upgrade. If nothing
    else, most applications should call
    <code class="function">confd_load_schemas()</code> (see <a class="xref" href="rn02re13.html" title="confd_lib_lib"><span class="refentrytitle">confd_lib_lib</span>(3)</a>) when an upgrade has completed, in
    order to update the in-memory representation of the data model. The
    <code class="filename">cdb_subscriber.c</code> program in the example shows
    how this can be done.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e3691"></a>13.3.&nbsp;Initializing the Upgrade</h2></div></div></div><p>After having set up the MAAPI socket, the first step in the
    actual upgrade procedure is to call the
    <code class="function">maapi_init_upgrade()</code> function. Its purpose is
    to bring ConfD into "upgrade mode", where no transactions are
    running, and the northbound agents have entered a state that does
    not allow new transactions to be started.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">    progress("Initializing upgrade...\n");
    phase = "Init";
    /* run notifier in separate process
       - maapi_init_upgrade() blocks */
    notifier = run_notifier(timeout, force);
    OK(maapi_init_upgrade(maapisock, timeout,
                          force ? MAAPI_UPGRADE_KILL_ON_TIMEOUT : 0));
    if (notifier != -1)
        kill(notifier, SIGTERM);
    notifier = -1;
    progress("Init OK\n");
    maapi_prio_message(maapisock, "all",
                       "\n&gt;&gt;&gt; System upgrade in progress...\n");
</pre></div><p>If users have sessions in configure mode when this function is
    called, they are given the opportunity to exit from configure mode
    voluntarily. The function call will block until all transactions
    have been terminated (although not longer than specified by the
    timeout). For this reason, we fork() a process that periodically
    sends out messages to all users, informing them of the imminent
    upgrade.</p><p>If any transactions remain when the timeout expires,
    <code class="function">maapi_init_upgrade()</code> will fail with
    <code class="varname">confd_errno</code>
    <code class="constant">CONFD_ERR_TIMEOUT</code>, unless the
    <code class="constant">MAAPI_UPGRADE_KILL_ON_TIMEOUT</code> flag was used.
    If <code class="filename">upgrade.c</code> was given the <code class="option">-f</code>
    (force) option, it will pass this flag to
    <code class="function">maapi_init_upgrade()</code>, and any remaining
    transactions will be forcibly terminated instead.</p><p>When <code class="function">maapi_init_upgrade()</code> is called, a
    <code class="constant">CONFD_UPGRADE_INIT_STARTED</code> event notification
    is sent, and when it completes successfully, a
    <code class="constant">CONFD_UPGRADE_INIT_SUCCEEDED</code> event notification
    is sent.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If the function fails, i.e. it does not return
    <code class="constant">CONFD_OK</code>, ConfD will automatically abort the
    upgrade, reverting to the pre-upgrade state, and send a
    <code class="constant">CONFD_UPGRADE_ABORTED</code> event notification. This
    is true also for the functions described in in the next two
    sections.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e3714"></a>13.4.&nbsp;Performing the Upgrade</h2></div></div></div><p>When <code class="function">maapi_init_upgrade()</code> has completed
    successfully, the next step is to call
    <code class="function">maapi_perform_upgrade()</code>. This tells ConfD to
    load the new .fxs files etc, and we must pass it a list of
    directories to load these files from. These are the directories that
    will become the new loadPath directories once the upgrade is
    complete. These directories will also be searched for CDB "init
    files" (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#ug.cdb.init" title="5.8.&nbsp;Loading initial data into CDB">Section&nbsp;5.8, &#8220;Loading initial data into CDB&#8221;</a>), corresponding to the
    <code class="sgmltag-element">/confdConfig/cdb/initPath</code> directories that can be
    specified in <code class="filename">confd.conf</code>.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">    progress("Performing upgrade...\n");
    phase = "Perform";
    /* set up new loadpath directory */
    snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), PKG_DIR "/%s", version);
    load_dir[0] = &amp;buf[0];
    OK(maapi_perform_upgrade(maapisock, &amp;load_dir[0], ndirs));
    progress("Perform OK\n");
</pre></div><p>At this point <code class="filename">confd.conf</code> and hence the
    <code class="filename">current</code> symlink must still point to the current
    version, and thus we pass the new directory "explicitly" to the
    function as <code class="filename">"./pkg/v2"</code>. In this example ConfD
    was also started with the <code class="option">--addloadpath</code> option
    specifying an additional loadPath directory. The contents of this
    directory (<code class="filename">$CONFD_DIR/etc/confd</code>) does not
    change in the upgrade, but we must pass the same directory to
    <code class="function">maapi_perform_upgrade()</code> too - the files found
    in the given directories will completely replace what ConfD is
    currently using.</p><p>A number of different problems may be detected during the
    loading of the new files, e.g. .fxs files may have a version that is
    incompatible with the ConfD version, or they may reference
    namespaces that can not be found. These problems will make
    <code class="function">maapi_perform_upgrade()</code> fail with
    <code class="varname">confd_errno</code>
    <code class="constant">CONFD_ERR_BAD_CONFIG</code>, and
    <code class="function">confd_lasterr()</code> giving information about the
    details of the problem. If the loading is successful, CDB will start
    its special upgrade transaction, and perform any automatic upgrade
    operations that are needed, before
    <code class="function">maapi_perform_upgrade()</code> returns.</p><p>When <code class="function">maapi_perform_upgrade()</code> completes
    successfully, a <code class="constant">CONFD_UPGRADE_PERFORMED</code> event
    notification is sent.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e3740"></a>13.5.&nbsp;Committing the Upgrade</h2></div></div></div><p>When <code class="function">maapi_perform_upgrade()</code> has
    completed successfully, we must call
    <code class="function">maapi_commit_upgrade()</code> to tell ConfD to make
    the upgrade permanent. This will also tell CDB to commit its upgrade
    transaction, and we may need to take some actions for this before
    the call:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>If the upgrade requires that an external program
      modifies some CDB data, it must be done at this point, using
      <code class="function">maapi_attach_init()</code> as described in the CDB
      chapter.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the upgrade includes new validation points, or
      the validation logic for existing validation points has changed,
      the new validators must connect to ConfD and register for their
      validation points before
      <code class="function">maapi_commit_upgrade()</code> is called.</p></li></ul></div><p>In the example, all the changes can be handled by the
    automatic CDB upgrade, and we just proceed with the call:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">    progress("Committing upgrade...\n");
    phase = "Commit";
    OK(maapi_commit_upgrade(maapisock));
    relink(version);
    progress("Commit OK\n");

    maapi_prio_message(maapisock, "all",
                       "&gt;&gt;&gt; System upgrade has completed successfully.\n");
</pre></div><p><code class="function">maapi_commit_upgrade()</code> may fail if the
    upgraded data does not pass validation, and the errors returned in
    this case are the same as for e.g.
    <code class="function">maapi_apply_trans()</code>. Since this will also make
    ConfD automatically revert to the pre-upgrade state, we must not
    change the on-disk data to reflect the upgrade until
    <code class="function">maapi_commit_upgrade()</code> has succeeded.  In the
    code above, the <code class="function">relink()</code> call changes the
    symlink to point to the new version in an atomic manner.</p><p>When <code class="function">maapi_commit_upgrade()</code> completes
    successfully, a <code class="constant">CONFD_UPGRADE_COMMITED</code> event
    notification is sent.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e3763"></a>13.6.&nbsp;Aborting the Upgrade</h2></div></div></div><p>We can abort the upgrade at any point before the
    <code class="function">maapi_commit_upgrade()</code> call by calling
    <code class="function">maapi_abort_upgrade()</code>. However as noted above,
    this should not be done when one of the other functions fails, since
    ConfD aborts the upgrade automatically in those cases.</p><p>When <code class="function">maapi_abort_upgrade()</code> aborts an
    upgrade, a <code class="constant">CONFD_UPGRADE_ABORTED</code> event
    notification is sent.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e3771"></a>13.7.&nbsp;Upgrade and HA</h2></div></div></div><p>When we use the ConfD High Availability functionality, it is
    critical that all nodes in the HA cluster agree on the data model
    used. For this reason we can not do in-service upgrade on a ConfD
    instance that is part of a HA cluster. A ConfD node in HA state SLAVE
    or MASTER executing
    <code class="function">maapi_init_upgrade()</code> will fail with
    <code class="varname">confd_errno</code>
    <code class="constant">CONFD_ERR_HA_WITH_UPGRADE</code>. Conversely, when an
    in-service upgrade is in progress, calling
    <code class="function">confd_ha_beslave()</code> will also result in this
    error, and connections from slaves will be rejected.</p><p>Thus in-service upgrade is only possible while in HA-state
    NONE.</p><p>To do the in-service upgrade on a HA cluster, we must thus use
    "rolling upgrade":</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Disconnect one of the slaves from the cluster by calling
        <code class="function">confd_ha_benone().</code></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Upgrade the disconnected slave as described above.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Tell the upgraded slave to become master by calling
        <code class="function">confd_ha_bemaster().</code></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Tell the old master to not be master by calling confd_ha_benone()
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Upgrade the remaining nodes in the cluster one by one,
        telling each to connect as slave to the upgraded master by
        calling <code class="function">confd_ha_beslave()</code> when the upgrade
        is done.</p></li></ol></div><p>Alternatively, since the HA configuration should be able to
    handle that a node is stopped and restarted without service
    interruption, we may simply use the upgrade method described in the
    CDB chapter for the "rolling upgrade".</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch12.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center">&nbsp;</td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch14.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;12.&nbsp;Notifications&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;14.&nbsp;The AAA infrastructure</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
