This example shows how to implement an action callback. It is intended
to work with the netconf_extensions/simple_rpc example in the standard
ConfD distribution, replacing the math-capi.c implementation there that
does the same thing in C.

To run, first go to the $STD_EXAMPLES/netconf_extensions/simple_rpc
directory and

% make all
% make start-confd

then come back here and

% make all
% make estart

Then in the $STD_EXAMPLES/netconf_extensions/simple_rpc directory you
can do

% make query3
