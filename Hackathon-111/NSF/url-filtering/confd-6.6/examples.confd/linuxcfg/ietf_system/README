= The ietf_system component.

The 'ietf_system' component provides support for the IETF standard
RFC7317 model as described at
http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7317.txt

It implements the yang model taken from:
http://dld.netconfcentral.org/src/ietf-system@2014-05-14.yang

and also uses the iana-crypt-hash YANG module from:
http://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-crypt-hash/iana-crypt-hash

This implementation handles control over dns-resolvers, ntp servers
and the local clock as well as the hostname.

IMPORTANT: The authentication and radius branches are not implemented
in this release.

Requirements
------------

This should work on any "standard Linux" system, but has been tested
on Ubuntu 14.04.

Specific requirements:

  - The timezone settings requires the zic command.

  - The NTP functionality requires ntpd to be installed to have any
    effect.  The module has been tested with ntpd version 4.2.6p5, but
    should work on any recent version.
+
No other subsystem may control ntpd, it must be started and stopped
only through linuxcfg.

  - Hostname uses the hostname command.

Installation
------------

You must have installed the template config for ntp, preferably using
`../scripts/setup_ntp.sh`.

If your system uses `apparmor`, make sure `/etc/ntp/** r,` line
is present in the `etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.ntpd` file (usually it is present
by default and no change to the file is required).

Configuration notes
-------------------

Generic::

The commands and constants used are defined at the beginning of each
c-file, there you can also find the appropriate flags to change the
commands at compile-time.

NTP::

By default ntp-servers are stored in /etc/ntp-servers.conf to change
this you must modify both ../templates/ntp.conf.in and the NTP_CONFIG
define in ntp.c. NTP should be initialized by ../scripts/setup_ntp.sh
(which just copies ntp.conf.in into /etc).

NOTE: If AppArmor is used, make sure that read access for
/etc/ntp-servers.conf is enabled in /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.ntpd or
/etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.ntpd.

DNS::

DNS is configured by modifying /etc/resolv.conf.  No other process on
the system may modify the file at the same time or risk having its
changes overwritten.

Timezones::

The paths used are defined at the top of tz.c. Which timezones are
available will depend on what is installed on the system. It will by
default modify /etc/timezone and /etc/localtime.

Operational data::

Nodes under the system-state/platform subtree contains nodes such as
os-name and os-version that many users will want to customize, instead
of having it taken from uname.

This can be done by setting the defines `SYSTEM_OS_NAME`,
`SYSTEM_OS_VERSION`, `SYSTEM_OS_RELEASE` or `SYSTEM_MACHINE` to the desired
strings at compile time.
