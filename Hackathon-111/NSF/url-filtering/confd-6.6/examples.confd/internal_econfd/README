Running application code inside ConfD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this directory show how to use the Erlang ConfD API
("econfd") to run Erlang application code internally in the ConfD
daemon. This can be achieved by loading single Erlang modules into
the virtual machine or by packaging the code into (embedded) applications.

The examples below demonstrates the two styles:

  embedded_applications - recommended for most purposes

  single_modules - suffices for registration of user defined type handlers

For more information about this, read the section "Running application
code inside ConfD" in the "Advanced Topics" chapter of the User Guide.
