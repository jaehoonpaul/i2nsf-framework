Example showing a CDB client. This code configures yaws through ConfD
A simplified version of yaws.conf is found in yaws.yang
To build and run, first install yaws in /usr/local (or edit the Makefile
if yaws is installed elsewhere)



To compile and run

# make all
# make start

The above builds everything and starts confd with the right stuff loaded
Once compiled and started, do in another xterm - 

# make estart

The above starts the erlang based cdb client found in yconf.erl

In yet another xterm, start the confd cli and edit some yaws 
settings and see how the cdb client reacts
