Devstack systemd journal
========================

The devstack.journal file is a copy of the systemd journal during the
devstack run.

To use it, you will need to convert it so journalctl can read it
locally.  After downloading the file:

 $ /lib/systemd/systemd-journal-remote <(xzcat ./devstack.journal.xz) -o output.journal

Note this binary is not in the regular path.  On Debian/Ubuntu
platforms, you will need to have the "systemd-journal-remote" package
installed.

It should result in something like:

 Finishing after writing <large number> entries

You can then use journalctl to examine this file.  For example, to see
all devstack services try:

 $ journalctl --file ./output.journal -u 'devstack@*'

To see just cinder API server logs restrict the match with

 $ journalctl --file ./output.journal -u 'devstack@c-api'

There may be many types of logs available in the journal, a command like

 $ journalctl --file ./output.journal --output=json-pretty | grep "_SYSTEMD_UNIT" | sort -u

can help you find interesting things to filter on.
