CDB upgrade Example: Using init file to initialize new elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to use the XML init file for the new version
to initialize new elements.

A NETCONF client called 'netconf-console' is used in this example.
The 'netconf-console' is part of the ConfD installation (found in
the 'bin' directory). This client communicates with ConfD over SSH and
requires Python Paramiko package (on Ubuntu you can install it by command
'apt-get install python-paramiko').
In case SSH cannot be used, there is 'netconf-console-tcp' variant. To
use 'netconf-console-tcp', update 'confd.conf' to enable
'netconf/transport/tcp' and change all 'netconf-console' calls
to 'netconf-console-tcp' (in 'Makefile').

Running the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing

        $ make all start

Now ConfD is running with the first version of the servers.yang
data model. Inspect the current db using "make query" and use the
command line interface to add/delete servers under /servers/server. Or
proceed directly to step 2:

 2. Stop ConfD, build the new version of the .fxs file, copy the new
    init file to the CDB directory, and re-start ConfD using start-phases.
    All in one go:

        $ make start-v2

Notice how the database is upgraded to fit with the new schema, and
how new elements are initialized from the servers2_init.xml file. Again
use "make query" and "make cli" to inspect.
