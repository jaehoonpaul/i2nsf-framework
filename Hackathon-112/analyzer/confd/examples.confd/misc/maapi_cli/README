Example: Using MAAPI, the Management API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an example application which shows how to use the MAAPI API
(see confd_lib_maapi(3)) We're using the MAAPI interface here to build
a small proprietary trivial CLI application.

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing 

        $ make all start

    this will also start the example CLI application.

 2. In the example shell, type

	#maapi-demo-cli help

    to see a list of available commands.

 3. Add a server by typing

	#maapi-demo-cli create srv1 192.168.2.3 555
	#maapi-demo-cli show
