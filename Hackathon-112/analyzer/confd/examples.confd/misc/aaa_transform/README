Example to show how we can transform the fairly complicated
AAA trees which are required by ConfD into a much simpler structure
which could be incorporated somewhere in an application specific
context. This example utilizes the transformation technique described
in the user's guide chapter describing transforms.

A NETCONF client called 'netconf-console' is used in this example.
The 'netconf-console' is part of the ConfD installation (found in
the 'bin' directory). This client communicates with ConfD over SSH and
requires Python Paramiko package (on Ubuntu you can install it by command
'apt-get install python-paramiko').
In case SSH cannot be used, there is 'netconf-console-tcp' variant. To
use 'netconf-console-tcp', update 'confd.conf' to enable
'netconf/transport/tcp' and change all 'netconf-console' calls
to 'netconf-console-tcp' (in 'Makefile').

In a real application where we really want to hide tailf-aaa.yang and
ietf-netconf-acm.yang from all northbound interfaces, we would typically
use the --export flag when we compile these modules with confdc.
