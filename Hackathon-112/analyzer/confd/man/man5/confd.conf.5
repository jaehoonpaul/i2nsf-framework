.SH "NAME"
confd.conf \- ConfD daemon configuration file format
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Whenever we start (or reload) the ConfD daemon it reads its configuration from
/etc/confd/confd\&.conf
or from the file specified with the
\fB\-c\fR
option, as described in
\m[blue]\fBconfd(1)\fR\m[]\&.
.PP
confd\&.conf
is an XML configuration file formally defined by a W3C XML Schema, as referred to in the SEE ALSO section\&. This schema file is included in the distribution\&. The ConfD distribution also includes a commented confd\&.conf\&.example file\&.

Many configuration parameters get their default values as defined in the schema\&. Filename parameters have no default values\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.PP
This section lists all available configuration parameters and their type (within parenthesis) and default values (within square brackets)\&. Parameters are written using a path notation to make it easier to see how they relate to each other:
.PP
/confdConfig

The top\-level element\&.
.RE
.PP
/confdConfig/confdIpcAddress/ip
.RS 4
ConfD listens by default on 127\&.0\&.0\&.1:4565 for incoming TCP connections from CDB, MAAPI, the CLI, the external database API, as well as commands from the confd script (such as "confd \-\-reload")\&.
.sp
This value and port (below) can be changed\&. If they are changed all clients using MAAPI, CDB et\&.c\&. must be re\-compiled to handle this\&. See the
\m[blue]\fBConfD IPC section in the Advanced Topics chapter in the User Guide\fR\m[]
on how to do this\&.
.sp
Note that there are severe security implications involved if ConfD is instructed to bind(2) to anything but localhost\&. Read more about this in the
\m[blue]\fBConfD IPC section in the Advanced Topics chapter in the User Guide\fR\m[]\&. Use the IP 0\&.0\&.0\&.0 if you want ConfD to to listen(2) on all IPv4 addresses\&.

.RS 4
enabled is either "true" or "false"\&. By default (false) Confd will refuse to start if any of its nortbound agents fails to bind their respective ports\&. When enabled, this parameter forces Confd to ignore that fatal error situation and instead it just issues a warning and disables the failing agent\&.

/confdConfig/enableSharedMemorySchema (boolean) [false]

.RS 4
the executable that setup the shared memory holding the schema\&. If left unconfigured, the included executable $CONFD_DIR/lib/confd/lib/core/confd/priv/mmap_schema is used\&. Using mmap_schema means ConfD creates and maintains the backing file, meaning that you don\*(Aqt have to write your own application\&. Note that if the value is configured, it must be specified as an absolute path (i\&.e containing the root directory and all other subdirectories leading to the executable)\&.
.RE
.PP
/confdConfig/loadPath/dir
.RS 4
The loadPath element contains any number of dir elements\&. Each dir element points to a directory path on disk which is searched for compiled YANG files (\&.fxs files), and compiled clispec files (\&.ccl file) during daemon startup\&.
.RE
.PP
/confdConfig/stateDir

This is where ConfD writes persistent state data\&. Currently the only state files are \*(Aqrunning\&.invalid\*(Aq which exists only if the running database status is invalid, which it will be if one of the database implementation fails during the two\-phase commit protocol, and \*(Aqglobal\&.data\*(Aq which is used to store some data that needs to be retained across reboots\&.

.PP
/confdConfig/commitRetryTimeout(xs:duration|infinity) [PT0S]

Commit timeout in the ConfD backplane\&. This timeout controls for how long the commit operation will attempt to complete the operation when some other entity is locking the database, e\&.g\&. some other commit is in progress or some managed object is locking the database\&.
.RE
.PP
/confdConfig/maxValidationErrors(uint32|unbounded) [1]

Controls how many validation errors are collected and presented to the user at a time when the user performs a validate or commit operation\&. Note that syntactical errors are detected and reported when the data is entered, and thus not covered by this parameter\&.
.RE

/confdConfig/hideGroup \- container element
.RS 4
Hide groups that can be unhidden must be listed here\&. Multiple hideGroup entries are allowed in the confd\&.conf file\&.
.sp
If a hide groups does not have a hideGroup entry, then it cannot be unhidden using the CLI \*(Aqunhide\*(Aq command\&. However, it is possible to add a hideGroup entry to the confd\&.conf file and then use confd \-\-reload to make it available in the CLI\&. This may be useful to enable for example a diagnostics hide groups that you do not event want accessible using a password\&.

A password can optionally be specified for a hide group\&. If no password or callback is given then the hide group can be unhidden without giving a password\&.

.sp
To completely disable a hide group, ie make it impossible to unhide it, remove the entire hideGroup container for that hide group\&.
.RE
.PP
/confdConfig/hideGroup/callback (string) []
.RS 4
A callback can optionally be specified for a hide group\&. If no callback or password is given then the hide group can be unhidden without giving a password\&.
.sp
If a callback is specified then the hide group cannot be enabled unless a password is entered and the callback successfully verifies the password\&. Using a callback it is possible to have short lived unhide passwords and per\-user unhide passwords\&.
.sp
The callback must be registered as a
\fBcommand()\fR
callback with
\fBconfd_register_action_cbs()\fR, see
\m[blue]\fBconfd_lib_dp(3)\fR\m[]\&. The
\fIpath\fR
argument to the callback is always
"hidegroup", while
\fIargv[0]\fR
is the name of the hide group,
\fIargv[1]\fR
is the name of the user issuing the unhide command, and
\fIargv[2]\fR
is the given password\&. The callback should return CONFD_OK to allow the unhiding, otherwise CONFD_ERR\&.

With asynchronous replication, a transaction updating the configuration is allowed to complete as soon as the updates have been sent to the connected slaves\&. With the default synchronous replication, the transaction is suspended until the updates have been completely propagated to the slaves, and the subscribers on the slaves (if any) have acknowledged their subscription notifications (see

tailf:cdb\-oper, see

It is possible to override this by using this setting in confd\&.conf\&. If "never", CDB will only keep the operational datastore in RAM\&. And if set to "always" all CDB stored operational data will be persistently backed to a file\&.

When CDB replication is enabled (which it is when high\-availability mode is enabled, see /confdConfig/ha) the CDB operational store can optionally be replicated too\&. When set to "persistent", only persistent operational data is replicated\&. When set to "never", CDB operational is never replicated\&. Using "always" means that both persistent and non\-persistent data is replicated\&. Note however that non\-persistent data is only replicated to connected slaves at the time of writing\&.

When CDB replication is enabled (which it is when high\-availability mode is enabled, see /confdConfig/ha) the replication of the CDB operational store (according to
/confdConfig/cdb/operational/replication) can be done either asynchronously or synchronously\&.
