Backported, durable, and portable selectors designed to replace
the standard library selectors module.

Features
--------

* Support for all major platforms. (Linux, Mac OS, Windows)
* Support for Python 2.6 or later and **Jython**.
* Support many different selectors
    * ``select.kqueue`` (BSD, Mac OS)
    * ``select.devpoll`` (Solaris)
    * ``select.epoll`` (Linux 2.5.44+)
    * ``select.poll`` (Linux, Mac OS)
    * ``select.select`` - (Linux, Mac OS, Windows)
* Support for `PEP 475 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0475/>`_ (Retries system calls on interrupt)
* Support for modules which monkey-patch the standard library after import (like greenlet, gevent)
* Support for systems which define a selector being available but don't actually implement it. ()

About
-----

This module was originally written by me for the `urllib3 <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_ project
(history in PR `#1001 <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/1001>`_) but it was decided that it would
be beneficial for everyone to have access to this work.

All the additional features that ``selectors2`` provides are real-world problems that have occurred
and been reported during the lifetime of its maintenance and use within ``urllib3``.

If this work is useful to you, `feel free to say thanks <https://saythanks.io/to/SethMichaelLarson>`_,
takes only a little time and really brightens my day! :cake:

Can this module be used in place of ``selectors``?
--------------------------------------------------

Yes! This module is a 1-to-1 drop-in replacement for ``selectors`` and
provides all selector types that would be available in ``selectors`` including
``DevpollSelector``, ``KqueueSelector``, ``EpollSelector``, ``PollSelector``, and ``SelectSelector``.

What is different between `selectors2` and `selectors34`?
---------------------------------------------------------

This module is similar to ``selectors34`` in that it supports Python 2.6 - 3.3
but differs in that this module also implements PEP 475 for the backported selectors.
This allows similar behaviour between Python 3.5+ selectors and selectors from before PEP 475.
In ``selectors34``, an interrupted system call would result in an incorrect return of no events, which
for some use cases is not an acceptable behavior.

I will also add here that ``selectors2`` also makes large improvements on the test suite surrounding it
providing 100% test coverage for each selector.  The test suite is also more robust and tests durability
of the selectors in many different situations that aren't tested in ``selectors34``.

What types of objects are supported?
------------------------------------

At this current time ``selectors2`` only support the ``SelectSelector`` for Windows which cannot select on non-socket objects.
On Linux and Mac OS, both sockets and pipes are supported (some other types may be supported as well, such as fifos or special file devices).

What if I have to support a platform without ``select.select``?
---------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few platforms that don't have a selector available, notably
Google AppEngine. When running on those platforms any call to ``DefaultSelector()``
will raise a ``RuntimeError`` explaining that there are no selectors available.

Installation
------------

``$ python -m pip install selectors2``

Usage
-----
.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    import selectors2 as selectors

    # Use DefaultSelector, it picks the best
    # selector available for your platform! :)
    s = selectors.DefaultSelector()

    import socket

    # We're going to use Google as an example.
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.connect(("www.google.com", 80))

    # Register the file to be watched for write availibility.
    s.register(sock, selectors.EVENT_WRITE)

    # Give a timeout in seconds or no
    # timeout to block until an event happens.
    events = s.select(timeout=1.0)

    # Loop over all events that happened.
    for key, event in events:
        if event & selectors.EVENT_WRITE:
            key.fileobj.send(b'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n')

    # Change what event you're waiting for.
    s.modify(sock, selectors.EVENT_READ)

    # Timeout of None let's the selector wait as long as it needs to.
    events = s.select(timeout=None)
    for key, event in events:
        if event & selectors.EVENT_READ:
            data = key.fileobj.recv(4096)
            print(data)

    # Stop watching the socket.
    s.unregister(sock)
    sock.close()
