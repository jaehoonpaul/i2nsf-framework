Example: Plug and play scripting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how to add CLI commands, policy scripts and
post-commit hooks by means of the scripting mechanism. In order to
make this work we need to add one or more script directories to
confd.conf:

    <scripts>
      <dir>scripts</dir>
    </scripts>

In this example we have one CLI command (echo.sh), one policy script
(check_number_of_hosts.sh) and one post-commit hook
(show_diff.sh). The directory structure looks like this:

    # find scripts
    scripts
    scripts/command
    scripts/command/echo.sh
    scripts/policy
    scripts/policy/check_number_of_hosts.sh
    scripts/post-commit
    scripts/post-commit/show_diff.sh

The interface of the scripts are defined by the scripts themselves.
ConfD invokes the scripts to determine the their interfaces. This is
automatically done at startup and manually on demand via the
"script reload" CLI command. In this case the new CLI command will
be named "my script echo".

In this example we do also have a CLI command that is added via the
clispec mechanism, see confd.c.cli and confd.j.cli respectively. The
command "my clispec echo" defined in the clispec is equivalent to the
command "my script echo" defined by echo.sh.

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing

    # make all start

 2. To see what's happening inside ConfD, optionally tail the ConfD
    log file. Unless you have changed the default configuration for
    this example (see confd.conf) the command would be

    # tail -f ./confd.log

 3. Start the CLI with 'make cli' and try the following:
    # make cli
    admin connected from 127.0.0.1 using console on tellus
    admin@tellus>

 4. Run the CLI commands

    admin@tellus> my script echo ?
    Possible completions:
      String to be displayed
      file - Redirect output to file
      nolf - Do not output the trailing newline
    admin@tellus> my script echo hello world
    hello world
    [ok][2013-02-15 15:10:13]
    admin@tellus> my clispec ?
    Possible completions:
      echo - Display a line of text
    admin@tellus>

 5. Violate constraint in policy script

    admin@tellus# config
    Entering configuration mode terminal
    admin@tellus(config)# show full-configuration simpleObjects maxNumberOfHosts
    simpleObjects maxNumberOfHosts 10
    admin@tellus(config)# simpleObjects numberOfHosts 15
    admin@tellus(config)# commit
    Aborted: /simpleObjects/numberOfHosts may not be greater than 10
    admin@tellus(config)#

6. Reload changed scripts

    admin@tellus> script reload ?
    Possible completions:
      all    - Show info about all scripts
      debug  - Show additional debug info about the scripts
      diff   - Show info about scripts changed since last reload
      errors - Show info about erroneous scripts
    admin@tellus> script reload all

        command:
            echo.sh: unchanged
