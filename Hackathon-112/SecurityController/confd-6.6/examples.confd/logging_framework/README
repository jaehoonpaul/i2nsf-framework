Logging Framework (traceh.h) integration with ConfD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This illustrates how to use logging framework (traceh.h) in C/C++
application and how to integrate it with ConfD.

The logging framework header file is located in example directory
(examples.confd/include). It is recommended to set CFLAGS to
add this into include path:

CFLAGS += -I$(CONFD_DIR)/examples.confd/include

The framework consists of one header. It can included like this:

#define _TRACE_DECLARE
#include <traceh.h>

If you include 'trace.h' in several files, use ''#define _TRACE_DECLARE'
only in one of them! This instructs the logging framework to
define supporting functions which should be done only once.

The default compiled logging level is set to level INFO in
the Makefile with line:

CFLAGS += -DT_LOG_INFO

It can be changed to:
T_LOG_FATAL, T_LOG_WARN, T_LOG_INFO, T_LOG_DEBUG or T_LOG_TRACE

The runtime controlled logging level is set with use of subscriber.

Validation checks that runtime level has not higher verbosity
than compiled logging level (e.g. it is not possible to use TRACE level
in runtime, if compiled level is only INFO).

The data provider provides state data.

Building and running
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build and start this example, run:

# make clean all start

If you want to stop the ConfD daemon, run:

# make stop

If you want to login via the CLI, run:

# make cli

Use case (in CLI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) See state (operational) data

# show logging-state
logging-state console-level info
logging-state stream-level info
logging-state syslog-level info
logging-state compiled-level info
logging-state syslog_initialized false
logging-state streams_initialized false


2) Configure

# config
Entering configuration mode terminal
(config)# logging console-level warn
# commit
Commit complete.
# do show logging-state
logging-state console-level warn
logging-state stream-level info
logging-state syslog-level info
logging-state compiled-level info
logging-state syslog_initialized false
logging-state streams_initialized false

3) See validation in action

# logging console-level trace
(config)# commit
Aborted: 'logging console-level': Level TRACE cannot be set as it is more
          detailed than compiled level INFO!
(config)#
