Using CDB iteration to discover which value have been changed 
---------------------------------------------------------------

This example demonstrates how to use cdb_iterate() and
traverse the change set committed in the transaction.
The code performs in-place updates. An alternative to the
strategy demonstrated in this code is to traverse the changeset
and mark up various parts of the configuration for reload and then
perform the reload from CDB after the traversal of the changeset.

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD and the CDB client by
    typing

        $ make all start

    The CDB client will be running in the foreground.

 2. In another window, 

        $ make cli
        > configure
        > set root ......
