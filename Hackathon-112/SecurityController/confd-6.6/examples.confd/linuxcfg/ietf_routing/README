General
-------

The `ietf_routing` component provides support for the IETF standard
 "RFC 8022: A YANG Data Model for Routing Management"
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8022).

It enables configuration of both IPv4 and IPv6 static routes.

Requirements
------------

This should work on any "standard Linux" system, but has been tested
on Ubuntu 14.04, 16.10

Specific requirements:

 - You must have enabled the `ietf_interfaces` and `ip` `linuxcfg` component.

Installation
------------

No specific installation required, but no other system should be
managing the interfaces at the same time.

Example:

Config:

```
interfaces interface enp0s25 type ethernetCsmacd
enabled
ipv4 address 11.0.2.15 prefix-length 24
ipv6 address 7777::1 prefix-length 64
commit

routing control-plane-protocols control-plane-protocol static protstatic
static-routes ipv4 route 14.0.2.0/24 next-hop next-hop-address 11.0.2.16
commit

routing control-plane-protocols control-plane-protocol static protstatic
static-routes ipv6 route 6667::/64 next-hop next-hop-address 7777::2
commit
```

State (operational) data:

```
do show routing-state
routing-state interfaces interface [ lo enp0s3 ]
routing-state ribs rib system-IPv4
 address-family ipv4-unicast
 routes route
  source-protocol         direct
  v4ur:destination-prefix 11.0.2.0/24
  next-hop outgoing-interface enp0s3
routing-state ribs rib system-IPv6
 address-family ipv6-unicast
 routes route
  route-preference        1024
  source-protocol         static
  v6ur:destination-prefix 666c::/64
```

Action `active-route`:

```
# routing-state ribs rib system-IPv4 active-route
  v4ur:destination-address 15.0.6.22
route {
    destination-prefix 15.0.6.22/32
    next-hop {
        next-hop-address 11.0.2.20
        outgoing-interface enp0s3
    }
}
```

Limitations
-----------

- `/confdConfig/cli/reallocateOperTrans` must be set to `true`
- only `static-routes` can be configured
- `action active-route` does not report protocol for IPV4 routes
   (as protocol is not reported by netlink)
- `receive` special next-hop is not supported
- validation is not fully implemented (see linuxcfg.log)
  (e.g. `ipv6` nexthop-address must be different from interface address)
- RT26183 - disabled when statement check that static routes can be configured
  only under static protocol type (make sure  control-plane-protocol is
  of type "static")
- RT26927 - when statement controlling available config is not working
- deletion of ipv6 route with next-hop list deletes only first next-hop
  (different behavior of `iproute2` for ipv4 and ipv6)
- when interface is changed in a way it has impact on routing table in the
  system, the routes are not re-applied (routing component is not connected
  with interface component)
- 'router-id' state data is not returned
- 'control-plane-protocols' state data is not returned (in 'routing-state')

Troubleshooting
---------------

- error messages have to be searched in the linuxcfg.log file
  (export LINUXCFG_OPTIONS='-i -l' before starting linuxcfg with `make start`
  or use "-i -l" start-up arguments)
