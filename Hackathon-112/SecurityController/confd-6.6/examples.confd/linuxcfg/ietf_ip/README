General
-------

The `ietf_ip` component provides support for the IETF standard
 "RFC 7277: A YANG Data Model for IP Management"
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7277). It extends the `ietf_interfaces`
model.

It enables configuration of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and
neighbor-tables on an interface and tries to make sure it is synced
to the actual interface.

The component implements the yang model taken from:
 http://www.netconfcentral.org/modules/ietf-ip

In particular
 http://dld.netconfcentral.org/src/ietf-interfaces@2014-05-08.yang

and also uses the 'iana-if-type' YANG module from:
http://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-if-type-yang/iana-if-type-yang

Requirements
------------

This should work on any "standard Linux" system, but has been tested
on Ubuntu 14.04.

Specific requirements:

 - You must have enabled the `ietf_interfaces` component.
 - It uses the `ip` and `sysctl` commands.


Installation
------------

No specific installation required, but no other system should be
managing the interfaces at the same time.

Configuration notes
-------------------

Generic::

The commands and constants used are defined at the beginning of each
c-file, there you can also find the appropriate flags to change the
commands at compile-time.

Operational data::
The data is coordinated with that for `IP-MIB` in the 'ipmibs'
component and gathers information through the existing mechanisms.


Developers hints
----------------

The code is divided into four parts:

 - A relatively simple top level handler (`ietf_ip.c`) that
   coordinates the protocol versions.

 - A state container (`iflist.c`) that keeps a local copy of the
 interface state and configurations. It also contains a few macros
 `DECLARE_SIMPLE_HANDLER` and `DECLARE_LIST_HANDLER` that simplifies
 the use of the list so that you only have to provide the function to
 apply a variable to the interface.

 - The IPv4 handler that handles the IPv4 subtree, both for config and
   operational data.

 - The IPv6 handler that handles the IPv6 subtree, both for config and
   operational data.
