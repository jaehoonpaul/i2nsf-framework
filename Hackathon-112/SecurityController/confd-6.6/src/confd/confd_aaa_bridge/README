This directory contains the source for confd_aaa_bridge.
See man confd_aaa_bridge(1).

This is an example implementation on how to populate the
ConfD /aaa tree with data from an external source - in
this case an adhoc .ini file.

Also see the AAA section in the User Guide.

ConfD ships with a built-in version of the program found
here. The built-in version is enabled by the directive
  /confdConfig/aaa/aaaBridge
in the confd.conf file (see confd.conf(5)).

If you want to run an external version (e.g. this code),
the built-in confd_aaa_bridge must be disabled.

So, to run this:

1. Disable the automatic startup of confd_aaa_bridge in
   confd.conf.

2. Compile this code.

3. Make sure that ConfD loads the generated aaa_bridge.fxs from
   this directory as opposed to the normal confd_cdb.fxs. Both
   of the fxs files describe the same namespace, with the
   difference that aaa_bridge.fxs also defines a callpoint for
   C, precisely the callpoint which this program,
   confd_aaa_bridge.c, connects to.

4. Start ConfD (no AAA is loaded and the system is unusable).

5. Start this program with the example data file as
   ./confd_aaa_bridge -i -t -c ./confd.aaa

6. Study the source code.
