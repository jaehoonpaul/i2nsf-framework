Example #2: Running a ConfD Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aim of the second example is to demonstrate some different ways to
interact with ConfD like an operator would; to view the current
configuration, alter it, show statistics, or test and control the
system using commands such as ping.

At this time, ConfD supports four main northbound access methods; the
Command Line Interface (CLI), the NETCONF protocol, a Web User
Interface (Web UI), and SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). The
term 'northbound' means towards the operator/user/manager (since they
are usually drawn at the top of architectural drawings).

As you'll see, the CLI, NETCONF and Web interfaces are all generated
automatically, simply from the ConfSpecs in the system. There is no
need to write additional code to make it work. The SNMP interface can
also be automatically generated, see examples.confd/snmpa for further
details on this.

A NETCONF client called 'netconf-console' is used in this example.
The 'netconf-console' is part of the ConfD installation (found in
the 'bin' directory). This client communicates with ConfD over SSH and
requires Python Paramiko package (on Ubuntu you can install it by command
'apt-get install python-paramiko').
In case SSH cannot be used, there is 'netconf-console-tcp' variant. To
use 'netconf-console-tcp', update 'confd.conf' to enable
'netconf/transport/tcp' and change all 'netconf-console' calls
to 'netconf-console-tcp' (in 'Makefile').

Using the CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Command Line Interface (CLI) in ConfD can run in two different
modes, a Juniper JunOS-style CLI and a Cisco IOS XR-style CLI. It's
designed to be used frequently and very quickly by operators and
developers on a daily basis. It's rich in editing features like
searchable command history, tab completion on both commands and
content.

The CLI is extensible so that new commands can be added at the top
level or further down in the tree. The commands can be external
commands (e.g. ping) or internal commands such as wizards that prompt
the user and access the database easily.

Before you start the CLI, make sure you've built and started ConfD and
the DHCP subscriber program from Example #1. If not, type 'make all
start'. Once ConfD is running, open up another window and start the
CLI with 'confd_cli' (be sure to have the $CONFD_DIR/bin directory in
your path). In the examples, you can also type 'make cli'.


Using the JunOS-style CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section shows the JunOS-style CLI. The next section demonstrates
the same thing using the IOS XR-style CLI. The JunOS-style CLI is not
available in ConfD Free.

    admin@machine>

You can always hit the <TAB>-key to fill in the rest of the command or
show a list of available choices or give a hint about what should be
filled in at this point. The same thing happens if you hit <SPACE>.

    admin@machine> conf<TAB>

gives

    admin@machine> configure

since 'configure' is the only command starting with 'conf'. Hitting
<TAB> again gives

    admin@machine> configure
    Possible completions:
    exclusive  private  shared
    admin@machine> configure

Typing p<TAB><ENTER> gives

    admin@machine> configure private
    Entering configuration mode "private"
    [ok][...]

    [edit]
    admin@machine%

You have now left the operational mode indicated by the '>' prompt and
entered configuration mode indicated by '%'. As you can see, there are
several configuration modes:

+ private mode
    This is the default. In this case all changes are private to your
    CLI and not visible to anyone else until you commit them. Others
    can also start their own private transactions.

+ shared mode
    This transaction is visible to everyone. Others can join in and
    change elements in the same transaction.

+ exclusive mode
    This mode prevents everyone else from starting shared or exclusive
    transactions and prevents any terminal/private transactions from
    committing anything until you have either committed or aborted
    your transaction.

You are now in private configuration mode. To see the list of available
commands here, hit <TAB>:

    admin@machine%
    Possible completions:
      commit   - Commit current set of changes
      compare  - Show configuration differences
      delete   - Delete a data element
      edit     - Edit a sub-element
      exit     - Exit from this level
      help     - Provide help information
      insert   - Insert a parameter
      load     - Load configuration from an ASCII file
      quit     - Exit from this level
      rename   - Rename an identifier
      resolved - Conflicts have been resolved
      revert   - Copy configuration from running
      rollback - Roll back database to last committed version
      run      - Run an operational-mode command
      save     - Save configuration to an ASCII file
      set      - Set a parameter
      show     - Show a parameter

      top      - Exit to top level of configuration
      up       - Exit one level of configuration
      validate - Validate current configuration

To configure a the DHCP server's default lease time to eight hours,
type:

    admin@machine% set dhcp <TAB>
    Possible completions:
      shared-networks  subnets       default-lease-time
      log-facility     max-lease-time
    admin@machine% set dhcp d<TAB>
    admin@machine% set dhcp default-lease-time<TAB>
    <duration: 600S> [600s]
    admin@machine% set dhcp default-lease-time 8h
    [ok][...]

    [edit]
    admin@machine%

This change will only take effect if/when you commit it.

    admin@machine% commit
    Commit complete.
    [ok][...]

    [edit]
    admin@machine%

If you want to change many items in a particular element, it may be
convenient to use the 'edit' command to make that element current.

    admin@machine% edit dhcp

    [edit dhcp]
    admin@machine% set max-lease-time 24h

    [edit dhcp]
    admin@machine% show
    dhcp {
        default-lease-time 4h;
        max-lease-time 24h;
        log-facility local7;
    }

    [edit dhcp]
    admin@machine%

You may think of 'edit' as the cd (change directory) command in a
typical UNIX shell. Note that the current edit position is indicated
above the prompt inside square brackets. To move up one level you can
use 'up'. To go back to the root level, you can use 'top'.

    [edit dhcp]
    admin@machine% top
    [ok][...]

    [edit]
    admin@machine%

You can go back to operational using 'exit', 'quit' or Ctrl+D.

    admin@machine>

The 'show' command displays configuration and operational data. To
display the DHCP configuration data, type

    admin@machine> show configuration dhcp
    dhcp {
        default-lease-time 8h;
    }

Voila! There's the DHCP daemon configuration right from the database.
Remember to use the <TAB>/<SPACE> key as you write to save some typing
and to see all choices. And you could have abbreviated the above to
simply 'sh co d <ENTER>'.

You can arbitrarily display any part of the tree, down to single leaf
nodes.

    admin@machine> show configuration dhcp default-lease-time
    default-lease-time 1h;

Try arrow-up or ^P, arrow-down or ^N to browse your command history.
^R starts a reverse-i-search like in the bash and most UNIX shells.
Other line editing keys familiar from bash are: ^A, ^E, ^B, ^F,
^K, ^T, ^W, ^C, M-F (Meta-F, ESC F), M-B (Meta-B, ESC B). Try them out
or read the CLI user's guide (or bash man page) to see what they do.

The help command can be used to find out more about a command.

    admin@machine> help file list
    Help for command: file list
        Display content of directory

You can also register external commands in the CLI. Either at the top
level, or into some kind of command tree. 'ping' would be a trivial
example, but you could invent commands like 'system info',
'system load firmware' and 'system reboot'.

You can also add interactive commands, even access to command shells
through ssh or telnet for example.

    admin@machine> ssh localhost

Exit the shell to get back to the CLI.

Using the 'file' command, you can list and display files.

    admin@machine> file list /etc

    admin@machine> file show confd.log

You have now left the operational mode and entered configuration mode
indicated by the '(config)' mode indicator. As you can see, there are
several configuration modes:

+ terminal mode
    This is the default. In this case all changes are private to your
    CLI and not visible to anyone else until you commit them. Others
    can also start their own terminal transactions.

+ shared mode
    This transaction is visible to everyone. Others can join in and
    change elements in the same transaction.

+ exclusive mode
    This mode prevents everyone else from starting shared or exclusive
    transactions and prevents any terminal/private transactions from

This change will only take effect if/when you commit it. This is the
way that Cisco's new line of products with the IOS XR Command Line
Interface works.

This transactional behavior enables more advanced configuration
operations without going through periods of invalid or pointless
configuration. Full and efficient validation of the configuration and
rolling back to previous known-good configurations are features also
enabled through the use of transactions.

    machine# file show confd.log


Using NETCONF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While we think you'll be using the Web UI or CLI most of the time, the
ConfD examples come with a trivial NETCONF manager called
'netconf-console'.  This is useful for demonstrating and testing the
ConfD NETCONF interface.

Just as the CLI and Web UI are completely designed for human
interaction (even though the CLI can be scripted), the NETCONF
interface is meant for programmatic access. Here, both the commands
and responses are encoded in XML.

Contained in the example, there are a number of NETCONF command files.
The command file that corresponds to the CLI command 'show
configuration dhcp' is called 'cmd-get-dhcpd.xml'. Take a look at it

    $ cat cmd-get-dhcpd.xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <hello xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
      <capabilities>
        <capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:base:1.0</capability>
      </capabilities>
    </hello>
    ]]>]]>
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <rpc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="1">
      <get>
        <filter xmlns="http://tail-f.com/ns/example/dhcpd">
          <dhcp/>
        </filter>
      </get>
    </rpc>
    ]]>]]>
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <rpc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="2">
      <close-session/>
    </rpc>

Here you see three XML messages separated by a ']]>]]>' sequence
(which can never be part of a well-formed XML document). The first
message is just a hello/capabilities negotiating message. The last
message just closes the session. The middle part is the actual query.
It does a NETCONF-get operation with a filter limiting the output to
the subtree that matches '/dhcp/'. To send this command, and see the
reply, type:

    $ netconf-console cmd-get-dhcpd.xml
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <rpc-reply xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="1">
      <data>
        <dhcpd:dhcp xmlns:dhcpd="http://tail-f.com/ns/example/dhcpd">
          <dhcpd:default-lease-time>PT600S</dhcpd:default-lease-time>
          <dhcpd:max-lease-time>PT7200S</dhcpd:max-lease-time>
          <dhcpd:log-facility>local7</dhcpd:log-facility>
          <dhcpd:subnets/>
          <dhcpd:shared-networks/>
        </dhcpd:dhcp>
      </data>
    </rpc-reply>

Actually, there's one reply message to each of the three messages
sent, but the default behavior of netconf-console is to omit the first
and last response message. Try 'netconf-console -s raw
cmd-get-dhcpd.xml' to see the actual, complete response without
prettyprinting.

The netconf-console program comes in two variants, the standard one
that uses SSH as specified in the NETCONF standard. The alternate one
is called netconf-console-tcp and uses plain TCP. This is the one we
used in the example above. This access method is outside the NETCONF
standard, but may nevertheless be useful.

Many operating systems are missing an SSH client module needed by
netconf-console called Paramiko. You can find out of this applies to
you by running:

    $ netconf-console cmd-get-dhcpd.xml

This should give the same result as using netconf-console-tcp
above. If you get an error message instead, please see the
$CONFD_DIR/README file (Troubleshooting, Problem 3.1) for
directions. Until you have Paramiko in place, you can use
netconf-console-tcp.


Subscriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DHCP subscriber uses a CDB feature called subscription to get
notified whenever a configuration change has occurred within the
relevant DHCP subtree of the system configuration.

The example dhcpd_conf.py subscribes to notifications for all changes
mathing the expression '/dhcp/'. When it receives a notification, it
re-reads it's entire configuration from CDB and generates a new
dhcpd.conf file. A real implementation would also restart the DHCP
daemon, since this is the only way to make it reread its
configuration.

The DHCP configuration is so small that there is no point in not
re-reading the entire configuration when something has changed. Some
other service with a larger data set would probably use multiple
subscriptions and diff iterators instead, to only re-read relevant parts
of the data tree. See examples.confd/cdb_subscription for an in-depth
treatment of the subject.

To see subscriptions in action, we need to do some changes to the DHCP
configuration, using the CLI or the netconf-console.

    $ netconf-console cmd-set-dhcpd-defaultLeaseTime-1h.xml
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <rpc-reply xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="1">
      <ok/>
    </rpc-reply>

Open up a separate terminal window in the example directory and type

    $ tail -F dhcpd.conf
    default-lease-time 3600
    max-lease-time 32
    log-facility local7

Note the capital F, it makes the tail command always look at the file
called 'dhcpd.conf', even if/when it is renamed, deleted and
recreated.

Now, make a change to the configuration

    $ netconf-console cmd-set-dhcp-defaultLeaseTime-30m.xml

The tail -F command has now added

    tail: `dhcpd.conf' has been replaced;  following end of new file
    default-lease-time 1800
    max-lease-time 32
    log-facility local7

Running a configuration command that in practice makes no change to
the data, will not trigger any subscription notification. Try running
the same command again

    $ netconf-console cmd-set-dhcp-defaultLeaseTime-30m.xml

No additional output is generated in the tail -F window.
