Environment

1) Install DevStack to use OpenStack environment (upper than Queens version).
  (1) Download source codes for OpenStack installation and simulation.
      Download link: Hackathon-104/stack
  (2) Install OpenStack by devstack
      # cd devstack
      # ./stack.sh
2) Create instances for Security Controller, DMS, and employees.
  (1) Security Controller: Allocate floating IP as 172.24.4.4
  (2) DMS: Allocate floating IP as 172.24.4.11
  (3) employee_1: Allocate floating IP as 172.24.4.8
  (4) keypair: create by the name 'demo-keypair'
3) Download source codes for each instance as follow:
  (1) Security Controller download link: Hackathon-104/SecurityController
  (2) DMS download link: Hackathon-104/DMS
4) Upload following images for NSFs to create as VNFs.

----------
Construction 

1) 'stack' account
  (1) Open new terminal and access to the 'stack' account.
      # sudo su - stack
  (2) Authorize by 'admin' user.
      # . adminrc
  (3) Run OpenStack Tacker and VNFFG environment
      # openstack_server.py


2) 'security-controller' instance
  (1) Open two new terminals and access to the 'security-controller' instance.
      # sudo su - stack  (enter password)
      # ssh -X -i .ssh/demo-keypair ubuntu@172.24.4.4
  (2) Terminal 1: Open NETCONF server for attaching DMS.
      # cd Registration
      # sudo make clean all start

  (3) Terminal 2: Run Security Controller server.
      # make target=testserver.py

------------

Test

1) Open new terminal and access to the 'DMS' instance.
   Open DMS server and register NSFs to Security Controller.
   # sudo su - stack  (enter password)
   # ssh -X -i .ssh/demo-keypair ubuntu@172.24.4.11
   # dms_server.py

2) Open new terminal and access to the 'employee' instance.
   Test ping to 'www.facebook.com' as follow:
   # sudo ssh -X -i /opt/stack/.ssh/demo-keypair ubuntu@172.24.4.8
   # ping www.facebook.com

   Test the others as follow:
   # ping www.google.com

3) Move to Terminal 2 of 'security-controller' instance, and enter as follow:
   > sns.txt
   
4) Check whether the policy is applied!
   Check the NSFs and policy tree in 'security-controller' instance

5  Check the ping test after applying the policy in employee instance.
   Repeat the step 2), then some SNS websites are blocked according to the policy in employee

----------
Termination

1) DMS
  (1) Move to DMS terminal
  (2) Enter 'Ctrl + C' for terminating server

2) Security Controller
  (1) Open new terminal and access to 'security-controller' instance
      # sudo su - stack  (enter password)
      # ssh -X -i .ssh/demo-keypair ubuntu@172.24.4.4
  (2) Terminate Security Controller
      # ./clean_security_controller

3) 'stack' account
  (1) Move to 'stack' terminal
  (2) Terminate OpenStack environment.
      # clean.py
