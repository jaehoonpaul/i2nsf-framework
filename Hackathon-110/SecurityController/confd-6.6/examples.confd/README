ConfD Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are a variety of ConfD examples of different complexity and
focus.  Each example contains one or more README files and a Makefile.

I recommend new users to start with the intro examples.  There is a
guided tour further down in this document.


Working with the Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ConfD examples can be copied and moved around.  To try something
out, make a copy of the example that comes closest to what you want to
do, then modify it as you want.

Let's say you would like to write an operational data provider. You
start with

    $ source ~/confd-X.X/confdrc


All examples come with a 'Makefile' with similar structure. Simply
typing 'make' in any example directory gives you a menu.  The make
targets below are pretty much standard for all examples, but some of
them have additional targets.

    $ make
    See README file for more instructions
    make all     Build all example files
    make clean   Remove all built and intermediary files
    make start   Start CONFD daemon and example agent
    make stop    Stop any CONFD daemon and example agent
    make cli     Start the CONFD Command Line Interface


Examples Tour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We highly recommend starting with the intro examples.  There you'll
find a suite of examples which shows you how to:

  * build, start, and interact with a ConfD example
  * create a simple managed object reading it's configuration and
    subscribing to configuration change events
  * write an operational data provider
  * integrate an external data store, this could be an external
    database or configuration file
  * add actions available to all northbound interfaces, this could be
    commands like 'reset interface eth2' or 'reboot'.

Open up $CONFD_DIR/examples.confd/intro/0-README to get started with the
intro examples.

When you're done with the intro and have got the hang of the ConfD
example makefiles, you can go in different directions depending on
your interest.

Northbound Management Interfaces

  * To take a look at the Web User Interface, go to examples.confd/webui.

  * A variety of NETCONF queries and commands are available in the
    examples.confd/intro/1-2-3-start-query-model example.  The NETCONF
    interface can be extended in various ways.  This is shown in
    examples.confd/netconf_extensions.

  * The Command Line Interface (CLI) is used in pretty much every
    example. To name one, go to examples.confd/intro/1-2-3-start-query-model.
    More examples are found in examples.confd/cli.

  * Examples of the SNMP Agent can be found in examples.confd/snmpa

Northbound Notifications

  * To work with NETCONF Notifications, go to
    examples.confd/netconf_notifications.

  * To work with SNMP notifications/traps, go to
    examples.confd/snmpa/3-sendtrap.

Working with the Data Tree

  * To look at validation of configuration data, go to
    examples.confd/validate.

  * To find out how to work with encrypted information in the data
    tree, go to examples.confd/crypto.

Working with the Database

  * To look at more advanced ways for Managed Objects to subscribe to
    changes to the configuration, go to examples.confd/cdb_subscription.

  * To look at how you can upgrade/downgrade the data stored in CDB at
    a new (or old) software version, go to examples.confd/cdb_upgrade.

  * To look at how operational (run-time) data can be stored in CDB,
    go to examples.confd/cdb_oper.

Managing ConfD

  * The High Availability API to ConfD, used to plug ConfD into an HA
    framework is demonstrated in examples.confd/ha.

  * Advanced uses of audit log information and other ConfD events is
    demonstrated in examples.confd/misc/notifications.

Model Transformation

  * To get the most out of the YANG and to show different views of
    the data model to different users or northbound interfaces, you
    can use transformations. Some of this power is demonstrated in
    examples.confd/misc/gen_transform.

  * A simpler way of handling users is built using a transform in
    examples.confd/misc/aaa_transform.

Miscellaneous

  * To see the SNMP gateway, which makes data from an external SNMP agent
    available to ConfD, see examples.confd/misc/snmpgw.

  * To see the full examples from the User Guide, go to
    examples.confd/user_guide_examples.

This list isn't exhaustive, and the list is constantly growing because
we are creating new examples as a way to show customers how to use
ConfD to attain their goals.  If you have an idea for an example,
please don't hesitate to tell us.
