Running application code inside ConfD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this directory show how to use the Erlang ConfD API
("econfd") to run Erlang application code internally in the ConfD
daemon.

  transform     - An implementation of the same transform as in the
                  misc/aaa_transform example, but written in Erlang and
                  running inside ConfD.

  user_type     - An Erlang implementation of the callbacks for one of
                  the user-defined types in the misc/user_type example.

For more information about this, read the section "Running application
code inside ConfD" in the "Advanced Topics" chapter of the User Guide.
