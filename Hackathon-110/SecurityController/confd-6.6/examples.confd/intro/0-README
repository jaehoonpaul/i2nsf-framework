Introductory Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This suite of introductory examples are intended to be used as the
first hands-on experience for Tail-f ConfD product users. They may
also be used as a starting point for development work later.
The examples are independent,
so they will run in any order. Taking them in sequence is however
likely to give the smoothest learning curve.

These examples have been developed primarily for Linux. For most part,
any other UNIX will do just as well. You won't need root privileges to
compile and run these examples. Also, if you wish, you can install and
run ConfD right from your own user account. See Example #1 for more
details.

To get the most out of these examples, you are probably a C (or Python)
programmer with a reasonable understanding of XML and XML
Schema. At the very least, you need to understand the basics of Make
and Linux/UNIX type operating systems.

ConfD Scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ConfD is the Configuration Daemon. It runs on a target machine, along
with a set of services that the target machine hosts. ConfD enables an
operator or management system to configure the services running on the
target machine, and possibly on other machines that are subordinate to
this target machine.

An operator uses a Configuration Management tool to add, reconfigure
and remove services from the target machine. Another way of looking at
it is to view the target machine as a collection of Managed Objects. A
Managed Object could be anything from a network interface card to an
entire router.

There are several different kinds of Configuration Management tools,
ranging from very complex data center solutions to trivial command
line interfaces. As these examples demonstrate, ConfD supports
Configuration Management tools that connect through the NETCONF
protocol. ConfD also supports a production quality command line
interface, Web User Interface, and other access methods.

Data models (YANG)

In order for the Configuration Manager to have a clue about what
operations and information the Managed Objects provide, there are
YANG models. A good introduction to YANG can be found at
http://www.yang-central.org

Scenario #1

When an operator wants to get the list of IP addresses on the network
interfaces of the target machine, she uses the Configuration Manager
to formulate the question. In the case of a NETCONF capable
Configuration Manager, the query will be formulated as a series of XML
messages.

The Configuration Manager opens up a connection to the ConfD daemon
running on the target machine, sends the NETCONF/XML query, and waits
for a response. ConfD looks up the answer in the ConfD Configuration
Database (CDB) and returns it.

Scenario #2

Next, if the operator wants to know how many packets have been
dismissed by the firewall, the same thing happens. Only this
information is not stored in CDB, because this is not configuration
information, this is run-time statistics. ConfD then turns to one of
its ConfD data providers. A ConfD data provider is a program that has
registered with ConfD as being responsible for a certain part of the
information in the system.

ConfD looks up which one of the registered data providers keep track
of packets dismissed by the firewall, contacts the data provider to
retrieve the information. ConfD then returns the answer to the
operator.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start with one of the examples below:

+ Example #1: Starting ConfD
    Start here. This example will tell you how to build a simple
    example, configure ConfD and start a system.

+ Example #2: Running a ConfD Query
    How do you interface with ConfD? This example demonstrates some
    different ways of accessing ConfD.

+ Example #4: Read-only Instrumentation in Java
    This example shows how you can interface with read-only statistics
    sources in your target system using Java.
    If you are primarily a C programmer, you can skip to example #6.

+ Example #6: Read-only Instrumentation in C
    This is similar to Example #4, only implemented in C.  This
    example shows how you can interface with read-only statistics
    sources in your target system. This is useful for instrumenting
    existing C applications.

+ Example #7: Configuration Instrumentation in C
    Here's how you can interface with existing system services which
    act as their own databases.

+ Example #8: Actions in the Data Model Implemented in C
    This example shows how to define an action which operates on the
    data, how to implement such an action, and how to invoke the
    action from the CLI and NETCONF.

Now, go ahead and pick one of the examples. Open up the README file
for the exercise and follow the instructions.
