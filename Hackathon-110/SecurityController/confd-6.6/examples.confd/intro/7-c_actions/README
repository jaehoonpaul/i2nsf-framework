Example #7: Actions in the data model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how you can define an action in the data
model, how the action is implemented in C, and how to invoke the
action from the CLI and NETCONF. It also shows how to implement an
action as a standalone executable, in this case a perl script.

A NETCONF client called 'netconf-console' is used in this example.
The 'netconf-console' is part of the ConfD installation (found in
the 'bin' directory). This client communicates with ConfD over SSH and
requires Python Paramiko package (on Ubuntu you can install it by command
'apt-get install python-paramiko').
In case SSH cannot be used, there is 'netconf-console-tcp' variant. To
use 'netconf-console-tcp', update 'confd.conf' to enable
'netconf/transport/tcp' and change all 'netconf-console' calls
to 'netconf-console-tcp' (in 'Makefile').

What the Example Does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The actions program is implementing three actions, reboot, restart and
reset. These operations have been modeled in the YANG data model. Don't
be afraid, it's not actually rebooting, restarting or resetting
anything, it's just printing a message when each action is invoked.
The perl script ping.pl runs the 'ping' command.

For Juniper CLI see line that begins with (J). Not available in ConfD Free.
For Cisco XR CLI see line that begins with (C).

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing

        $ make all start

 2. To see what's happening inside ConfD, optionally tail the ConfD
    log file. Unless you have changed the default configuration for
    this example (see confd.conf) the command would be

        $ tail -f ./confd.log

 3. Start the CLI with 'make cli' and try some commands

       (J) > request config system reboot
       (J) > request config system restart mode foo

       (C) # config system reboot
       (C) # config system restart mode foo

 4. You can also compose the same queries using NETCONF. Try the
    cmd-*.xml commands in the example:

        ${CONFD_DIR}/bin/netconf-console cmd-invoke-action.xml
        ${CONFD_DIR}/bin/netconf-console cmd-invoke-action-err.xml

 5. Run the 'ping' action from the CLI - this requires that a 'host'
    entry is created first, e.g.:

        $ make cli

       (J) > configure
       (J) % set config host localhost
       (J) % commit
       (J) % run request config host localhost ping

       (C) # config
       (C) (config)# config host localhost
       (C) (config-host-localhost)# ping
