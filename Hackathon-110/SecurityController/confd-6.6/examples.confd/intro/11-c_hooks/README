ConfD Example hooks in the data model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how you can define set-hook and
transaction-hook in the data model, how the hook callback is
implemented in C.

In addition, the example also illustrates how to use MAAPI C API
in the hook callback functions.


What the Example does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. defines data model of (ipv4) 'hosts' and 'hosts_ipv6'
2. when (ipv4) host 'ip' address and 'netmask' is configured (not committed),
   the set-hook automatically pre-fills gateway ('gw') address with
   smallest network IP address (according to the netmask).
3. when configuration is committed, the (ipv4) 'hosts' are iterated and
   corresponding 'hosts_ipv6' are created (if not yet exists).
   The IPv4 'ip' address and gateway ('gw') are converted to the IPv6
   (prefix ::ffff:: is used).
   After that, all 'hosts_ipv6' are iterated, and those not having (ipv4)
   'hosts' counterpart are deleted.


Source code
~~~~~~~~~~~

1. 'main' function - registration of callbacks (transaction t_init and
   t_finish; set-hook create, remove, set_elem; transaction hook write_all)
2. 't_init' - first call attaches maapi socket (used by hooks)
3. 'hook_ip_mask_set' - set-hook set_elem callback; calculates gateway address
   (from 'ip' and 'netmask') and configures it ('gw')
4. 'hook_ip_mask_remove` - set-hook remove callback; only logs message when
    called
5. 'hook_ip_mask_create' - set-hook create callback; not used in our scenario,
    it should not be called, warning is displayed
6. 'hook_hosts_write_all' - transaction hook write_all callback;
    called during commit, creates and deletes 'hosts_ipv6' elements according
    to the 'hosts' elements

Starting and running the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing

        $ make all start

 2. Start the C-style CLI with 'make cli' in a different window and try some
    commands

config
hosts aa
ip 1.2.3.4
netmask 255.255.0.0
top
show configuration hosts
commit
do show running-config hosts
do show running-config hosts_ipv6

hosts bb
ip 5.6.7.8
commit
top
do show running-config hosts
do show running-config hosts_ipv6

no hosts aa
commit
do show running-config hosts
do show running-config hosts_ipv6

 3. Stop and clean

        $ make stop
        $ make clean
