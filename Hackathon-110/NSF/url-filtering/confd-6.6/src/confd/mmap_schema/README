This directory holds the source to the mmap_schema program that ConfD
uses to implement the functionality enabled by
/confdConfig/enableSharedMemorySchema in confd.conf (see the
confd.conf(5) manual page). If it needs tuning/tweaking for some
platform, the modified version can be compiled and installed in some
convenient location, with the pathname specified via
/confdConfig/sharedMemorySchemaExecutable.
