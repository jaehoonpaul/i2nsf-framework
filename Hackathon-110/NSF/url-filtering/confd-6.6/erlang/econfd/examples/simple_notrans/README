This example shows how the external db API works. Note that
this API is an alternative to CDB, if we use CDB to store our
config data, this API is not needed. It may however be used together
with the CDB API - if needed. Also notable is that this API is very
similar to the API used to provide statistics data, such as in the
procs example.

To run

% make all
% make start
% make estart

And then  in another xterm - start the confd_cli or
use the netconf-console to read the config
