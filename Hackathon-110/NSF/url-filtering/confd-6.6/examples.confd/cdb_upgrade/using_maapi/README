CDB upgrade Example: Using MAAPI to initialize new elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes it is not desirable to add a "default" attribute when a new
elem is added to a new version. This example demonstrates how to use
MAAPI to fill in values in this situation.

A NETCONF client called 'netconf-console' is used in this example.
The 'netconf-console' is part of the ConfD installation (found in
the 'bin' directory). This client communicates with ConfD over SSH and
requires Python Paramiko package (on Ubuntu you can install it by command
'apt-get install python-paramiko').
In case SSH cannot be used, there is 'netconf-console-tcp' variant. To
use 'netconf-console-tcp', update 'confd.conf' to enable
'netconf/transport/tcp' and change all 'netconf-console' calls
to 'netconf-console-tcp' (in 'Makefile').

Running the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing

        $ make all start

Now ConfD is running with the first version of the servers.yand
data model. Inspect the current db using "make query" and use the
command line interface to add/delete servers under /servers/server. Or
proceed directly to step 2:

 2. Stop ConfD, build the new version of the .fxs file, and re-start
    ConfD using start-phases. All in one go:

        $ make start-v2

Notice how the database is upgraded to fit with the new schema. Again
use "make query" and "make cli" to inspect.
