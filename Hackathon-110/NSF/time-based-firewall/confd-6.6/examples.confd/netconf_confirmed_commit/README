ConfD Example - NETCONF confirmed commit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates NETCONF confirmed commit.

Part of the example is ConfD application with CDB subscription point
that prints modifications in CLI form. In this way one can observe how and when
the configuration is applied and rolled back.

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD and application by typing

        $ make clean all start

2. Start ConfD cli session for monitoring (in other terminal shell)

        $ make cli

3. Open other terminal shell for NETCONF (netconf-console)


Confirmed commit with persist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First see content of the files:

cmd-confirmed-id-commit-start.xml
cmd-confirmed-id-commit-confirm.xml
cmd-confirmed-id-commit-cancel.xml

1. Confirm with NETCONF

Restart everything

  $ make clean all start

In NETCONF shell run command to start confirmed commit

----
netconf-console cmd-confirmed-id-commit-start.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rpc-reply xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="1">
  <ok/>
</rpc-reply>
----

In CLI shell verify the configuration is in the running-config

----
Commit performed by admin via ssh using netconf.
# show running-config hosts
hosts host thost
 ip 192.168.1.33
!
----

In ConfD/Application shell see printed CLI modification commands

----
INFO app.c:35: Printing modifications
hosts host thost
 ip 192.168.1.33
!
----

In NETCONF shell run command to confirm confirmed commit and make it persistent

----
$ netconf-console cmd-confirmed-id-commit-confirm.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rpc-reply xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="1">
  <ok/>
</rpc-reply>
----

In CLI shell verify the configuration is still in the running-config

----
# show running-config hosts
hosts host thost
 ip 192.168.1.33
!
----

Wait default timeout 10 minutes (600s) according to RFC6241 8.4. and verify
in CLI the configuration is still in the running-config.

2. Cancel with NETCONF

Restart everything

  $ make clean all start

In NETCONF shell run command to start confirmed commit

----
netconf-console cmd-confirmed-id-commit-start.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rpc-reply xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="1">
  <ok/>
</rpc-reply>
----

In CLI shell verify the configuration is in the running-config

----
Commit performed by admin via ssh using netconf.
# show running-config hosts
hosts host thost
 ip 192.168.1.33
!
----

In ConfD/Application shell see printed CLI modification commands

----
INFO app.c:35: Printing modifications
hosts host thost
 ip 192.168.1.33
!
----

In NETCONF shell run command to cancel confirmed commit

----
netconf-console cmd-confirmed-id-commit-cancel.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rpc-reply xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="1">
  <ok/>
</rpc-reply>
----

In CLI shell verify the configuration is not in the running-config anymore
(it has been rolled back)

----
confirmed commit operation not confirmed by admin from netconf
# show running-config hosts
% No entries found.
----

In ConfD/Application shell see printed CLI modification commands representing
the rollback

----
INFO app.c:35: Printing modifications
no hosts host thost
----


3. Cancel with default timeout according to RFC6241

In NETCONF shell run command to start confirmed commit

----
netconf-console cmd-confirmed-id-commit-start.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rpc-reply xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="1">
  <ok/>
</rpc-reply>
----

In CLI shell verify the configuration is in the running-config

----
Commit performed by admin via ssh using netconf.
# show running-config hosts
hosts host thost
 ip 192.168.1.33
!
----

In ConfD/Application shell see printed CLI modification commands

----
INFO app.c:35: Printing modifications
hosts host thost
 ip 192.168.1.33
!
----

Wait more than default timeout period (600s = 10 minutes) from RFC6241 8.4.

When commit is not confirmed within this timeout, the configuration is reverted.

After timeout, in CLI shell verify the configuration is not in the
running-config anymore (it has been rolled back).

----
confirmed commit operation not confirmed by admin from netconf
configuration rolled back
# show running-config hosts
% No entries found.
----

In ConfD/Application shell see printed CLI modification commands representing
the rollback

----
INFO app.c:35: Printing modifications
no hosts host thost

Confirmed commit with timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to RFC6241 8.4, confirmed commit operation without <persist> element
must be confirmed in the same session. For this reason we cannot use file
approach as with persist, since when 'netconf-console' processes the file, it
also closes the session (even if <close-session> is missing).

We will use 'netconf-console' interactive mode to demonstrate timeout confirm
commit.

Restart everything and start CLI session (preferably in other shell terminal)

  $ make clean all start

  $ make cli

Start (in other shell terminal) 'netconf-console' in interactive mode

   $ netconf-console -i

Paste into 'netconf-console' <edit-config> command followed by the new line

<edit-config>
<target>
    <candidate/>
</target>
<config>
    <hosts xmlns="http://tail-f.com/ns/example/host"
           xmlns:nc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
        <host nc:operation="merge">
            <name>thost</name>
            <ip>192.168.1.33</ip>
        </host>
    </hosts>
</config>
</edit-config>

Paste into 'netconf-console' confirmed timeout <commit> command followed
by the new line

<commit>
    <confirmed/>
    <confirm-timeout>60</confirm-timeout>
</commit>

Before 60s timeout expires in the CLI shell verify the configuration is in
the running-config

----
Commit performed by admin via ssh using netconf.
# show running-config hosts
hosts host thost
 ip 192.168.1.33
!
----

In ConfD/Application shell see printed CLI modification commands

----
INFO app.c:35: Printing modifications
hosts host thost
 ip 192.168.1.33
!
----

After timeout, in CLI shell verify the configuration is not in the
running-config anymore (it has been rolled back).

----
confirmed commit operation not confirmed by admin from netconf
configuration rolled back
# show running-config hosts
% No entries found.
----

In ConfD/Application shell see printed CLI modification commands representing
the rollback

----
INFO app.c:35: Printing modifications
no hosts host thost
----

Paste again into 'netconf-console' <edit-config> command (above)
followed by the new line.

Paste again into 'netconf-console' confirmed timeout <commit> command (above)
followed by the new line

Before 60s timeout expires in the CLI shell verify the configuration is in
the running-config

----
Commit performed by admin via ssh using netconf.
# show running-config hosts
hosts host thost
 ip 192.168.1.33

----

In ConfD/Application shell see printed CLI modification commands

----
INFO app.c:35: Printing modifications
hosts host thost
 ip 192.168.1.33
!
----

Paste into 'netconf-console' confirming  <commit> command followed by
the new line

<commit/>

After 60s timeout expires in the CLI shell verify the configuration is still in
the running-config

----
# show running-config hosts
hosts host thost
 ip 192.168.1.33
