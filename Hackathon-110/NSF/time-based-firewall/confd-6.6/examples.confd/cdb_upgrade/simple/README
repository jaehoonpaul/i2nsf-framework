Very simple CDB upgrade Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example is a bit contrived. The only purpose of it is to
demonstrate how CDB does automatic upgrade.

A NETCONF client called 'netconf-console' is used in this example.
The 'netconf-console' is part of the ConfD installation (found in
the 'bin' directory). This client communicates with ConfD over SSH and
requires Python Paramiko package (on Ubuntu you can install it by command
'apt-get install python-paramiko').
In case SSH cannot be used, there is 'netconf-console-tcp' variant. To
use 'netconf-console-tcp', update 'confd.conf' to enable
'netconf/transport/tcp' and change all 'netconf-console' calls
to 'netconf-console-tcp' (in 'Makefile').

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing

        $ make all start

Now ConfD is running with the first version of the simple.yang
data model. Inspect the current db using "make query" and use the
command line interface to edit the values under /simple. Or proceed
directly to step 2:

 2. Stop ConfD, build the new version of the .fxs file, and re-start
    ConfD. All in one go:

        $ make start-v2

Notice how the database is upgraded to fit with the new schema. Again
use "make query" and "make cli" to inspect.
