Simple C Validation Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how a simple validation function may be
attached to an element in the YANG model. The validation function is
called during validation (the first stage of a transaction), and
either approves or fails the validation.

In many cases there is no need for a validation function at all since
many common constraints on valid configurations can be expressed
directly in the YANG model.

If this is not enough, more complex validations can be expressed
programatically. A typical example would be when the validity of an
element depends on the values of other elements.

Another reason for having a validation function could be to present a
warning to the user. This could be useful to warn about non-standard
or non-supported configurations, or configurations that would have
severe consequences, such as disconnecting current users.

A NETCONF client called 'netconf-console' is used in this example.
The 'netconf-console' is part of the ConfD installation (found in
the 'bin' directory). This client communicates with ConfD over SSH and
requires Python Paramiko package (on Ubuntu you can install it by command
'apt-get install python-paramiko').
In case SSH cannot be used, there is 'netconf-console-tcp' variant. To
use 'netconf-console-tcp', update 'confd.conf' to enable
'netconf/transport/tcp' and change all 'netconf-console' calls
to 'netconf-console-tcp' (in 'Makefile').

What the Example does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example uses a configuration of two integers, a and b. A
validation function validates that a is always larger than b.

The name of the validation function is in principle specified in the
YANG file. In this example we have chosen to use a YANG
annotation file to name the validation function. This allows us to add
or remove validation functions without modifying the data model.

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing 

        $ make all start

 2. In a different shell, start the CLI and display the configuration

        $ make cli
        ...

        (J) admin@localhost> show configuration mtest | details

        (C) localhost# show running-config mtest | details

	mtest a_number 42;
	mtest b_number 7;
	[ok][...]

 3. Configure the values so that a_number is larger than b_number

        (J) admin@localhost> configure
        (J) admin@localhost% edit mtest
        (J) admin@localhost% set a_number 15
        (J) admin@localhost% set b_number 8
        (J) admin@localhost% commit

        (C) localhost# config
        (C) localhost(config)# mtest a_number 15
        (C) localhost(config)# mtest b_number 8
        (C) localhost(config)# commit

 4. Attempt to mis-configure by changing a_number

        (J) admin@localhost% set a_number 8

        (C) localhost(config)# mtest a_number 8

        (J/C) admin@localhost% commit
	
        Aborted: 'mtest a_number': a_number is <= b_number
	[error][...]
        
        (J/C) admin@localhost% revert
        
        All configuration changes will be lost. Proceed? [yes,no] yes
        [ok][...]

 5. Attempt to mis-configure by changing b_number

        (J) admin@localhost% edit mtest
        (J) admin@localhost% set b_number 99
        (J) admin@localhost% commit

        (C) localhost(config)# mtest b_number 99
        (C) localhost(config)# commit
        	
        Aborted: 'mtest a_number': a_number is <= b_number
	[error][...]
        
        (J/C) admin@localhost% revert
        
        All configuration changes will be lost. Proceed? [yes,no] yes
        [ok][...]
