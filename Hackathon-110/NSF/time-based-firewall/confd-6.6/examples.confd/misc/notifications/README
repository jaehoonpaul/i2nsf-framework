Example: Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an example application which shows how to use the MAAPI API in
conjunction with the notifications API. We subscribe to diff
notifications, attach to the current transaction using maapi_attach()
and iterate over the diff from the transaction.

A NETCONF client called 'netconf-console' is used in this example.
The 'netconf-console' is part of the ConfD installation (found in
the 'bin' directory). This client communicates with ConfD over SSH and
requires Python Paramiko package (on Ubuntu you can install it by command
'apt-get install python-paramiko').
In case SSH cannot be used, there is 'netconf-console-tcp' variant. To
use 'netconf-console-tcp', update 'confd.conf' to enable
'netconf/transport/tcp' and change all 'netconf-console' calls
to 'netconf-console-tcp' (in 'Makefile').

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing

        $ make all start

 2. Run the CLI in another window and make some changes

        $ make cli


The program confd_notifications can be used standalone in a development
environment to monitor confd events.

# ./confd_notifications

Gives a usage message - one or more event types must be specified.

# ./confd_notifications -i

Sets up a notification socket and gets commit diff messages, iterating
over the diff.

# ./confd_notifications -A

Subscribes to all events except heartbeat, health check, and commit
simple (the information is a subset of commit diff).
