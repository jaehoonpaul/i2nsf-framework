Known issues in ConfD-6.5
=========================

- confd_str2val() (see confd_lib_lib(3)) and the corresponding functionality
  in the Java API does not enforce the 'pattern' restriction for string
  types.

- Two-phase CDB subscriptions are not available in the Java API.

- There are some limitations in the support of tab completion for
  instance identifiers in the CLI. The following is currently not
  supported:

    - quotes such as /service[address="192.168.0.1"][port="5000"]
    - help and info texts
    - path-filters

- Symmetric Multiprocessing is not supported on NetBSD, due to problems
  with the pthreads support on this OS.
